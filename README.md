## üìã Overview

The Magic Hand Assistive Gripper is designed as part of a cognitive training game for elderly users. In this game, users are given tasks such as picking and grabbing fruits based on specific instructions (for example, selecting fruits that total ¬•500 in value). The device encourages not just cognitive skills but also motor control - users must maintain smooth, confident movements while manipulating objects.

The device operates with a life percentage (starting at 100%) that decreases when jerky movements are detected by the built-in IMU sensor. This gamification aspect motivates users to develop better control while performing cognitive tasks. Final scores and performance metrics are transmitted via TCP/IP connection to a monitoring system for assessment and progress tracking.

Beyond the game scenario, the Magic Hand is an ergonomic device that helps elderly users manipulate and transport objects with greater control and confidence. The device monitors movement quality in real-time and provides immediate audio feedback, helping users develop smoother handling techniques and reduce the risk of dropping objects.

### üéØ Key Features

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) (1.8.x or newer)
- [M5StickC Plus2 Board Package](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/quick_start/m5stickc_plus2/arduino)
- USB Type-C cable
- WiFi network for TCP/IP connectivity

### Hardware Assembly

1. Ensure the M5StickC Plus2, the Magic Hand gripper, and the connecting assembly are available.
2. Connect the M5StickC Plus2 to the Magic Hand gripper mechanism using the provided mounting hardware.
3. Secure all connections and ensure the gripper mechanism operates smoothly.

### Software Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/anh0001/magic-hand-assistive-gripper.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd magic-hand-assistive-gripper
```

#### Setting up the Arduino IDE

1. Install the [M5StickC Plus2 library](https://github.com/m5stack/M5StickC-Plus2) via the Arduino Library Manager
2. Open the main sketch in the Arduino IDE:
   ```
   src/magic_hand_main/magic_hand_main.ino
   ```
3. Configure WiFi settings in the sketch by modifying:
   ```cpp
   const char* ssid = "YOUR_WIFI_SSID";
   const char* password = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";
   ```
4. Optionally configure a fixed IP for consistent connections:
   ```cpp
   IPAddress local_IP(192, 168, 1, 83);
   IPAddress gateway(192, 168, 1, 1);
   IPAddress subnet(255, 255, 255, 0);
   ```
5. Select "M5StickC Plus2" from the Board menu
6. Connect your M5StickC Plus2 via USB and select the appropriate port
7. Upload the sketch to your device

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

1. **Power On**: Press and hold Button C on the M5StickC Plus2 for more than 2 seconds
2. **Grip Operation**: 
   - Push the black handle to the left to close the gripper's fingers
   - Release to open the fingers
3. **Game Operation**:
   - Follow cognitive task instructions (e.g., grab fruits totaling ¬•500)
   - Maintain smooth movements to preserve the life percentage
   - Monitor feedback and adjust movements accordingly
4. **Feedback System**:
   - The buzzer remains silent during smooth movements
   - The buzzer beeps at increasing frequency when jerky movements are detected
   - Life percentage decreases with jerky movements
5. **Power Off**: Press and hold Button C for more than 6 seconds

### TCP/IP Connection

The device establishes a TCP server on port 9123 that can be accessed to:
- Start a new game session
- Retrieve current game state
- Monitor battery levels

To connect and interact with the TCP server:

```bash
# On macOS/Linux, use netcat to connect to the device
nc 192.168.1.83 9123

# Available commands:
# - start: Reset the game state to initial values (100% life)
# - finish: Retrieve current game state (life percentage and movement intensity)
# - batt: Request battery status information (percentage and voltage)
```

Example response for "finish" command:
```
Life: 85, Intensity: 0.23
```

Example response for "batt" command:
```
Battery: 78%, Voltage: 3.92V
```

This TCP/IP interface allows integration with external monitoring systems, game controllers, or assessment tools.

## üìä Technical Details

### Hardware Specifications

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Microcontroller | ESP32-PICO-V3-02 (240MHz dual-core) |
| Motion Sensor | MPU6886 6-Axis IMU |
| Display | 1.14" TFT (135√ó240) |
| Battery | 200mAh LiPo |
| Connectivity | WiFi (TCP/IP server on port 9123) |
| Gripper Length | 300mm |
| Finger Length | 77.5mm |

### System Architecture

The system uses the built-in IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) of the M5StickC Plus2 to detect acceleration and rotational changes. The software processes this data in real-time to identify movement patterns:

1. **Data Acquisition**: Continuous sampling from the accelerometer and gyroscope
2. **Movement Analysis**: Processing of motion data to detect irregularities
3. **Feedback Generation**: Activation of the buzzer with varying frequency based on movement quality
4. **Life Management**: Reduction of life percentage based on movement intensity
5. **Data Transmission**: Communication of game state via TCP/IP
